        FEATURES AND CHANGES ADDED TO EMERALD LEGACY:

        1. Added the Following Pokemon feature from Emerald Legacy Enhanced

        2. Added additional difficulty option "Limited Healing Mode" - When asked by professor Birch 
        about the Mauville power plant you can agree to limit your access to Pokecenters and Item Storage
        forcing you to plan your full heals and rely much more heavily on items out of battle. 3 new pokeceneters
        must be visited before you will be able to heal at an old one. Ater gym 6 this becomes less difficult to manage with fly.
        Importantly you will also lose half of your non-Key Items and HMS. Item loss will never soft lock you but it can make 
        things much tougher. TM's master balls, etc. are all up to be lost during a white out. This gives incentive to 
        avoid loss without resorting to nuzlocke rules. The hard/tough mode from the original Emerald Legacy has had the
        hard level cap removed and replaced with a soft cap to account for this difficulty option. XP gain will slow greatly 
        upon reaching the level cap but will not be halted. 
            Without this change, it would be possible to lock yourself into a no win situation
        with no pokeballs or way to alter your available options to deal with encounters. Ethers and similar
        PP restoring items have been added where appropriate to Pokemarts and other lcoations to help
        ease this difficulty as well. 

        3. BUFFS - All enemy trainers have had their teams buffed. If you're on the same level as an enemy pokemon expect the fight to 
        be an actual challenge. You might have to switch pokemon or consider move choice. The goal when buffing enemy trainer teams was 
        to keep the player from feeling like a super hero who cna mash a through most encounters safely. Enemy trainer AI has also been
        vastly improved. It won't be as smart as you are but it will try its best. Gym leaders, aqua/magma leaders, and the elite four have
        also seen significant buffs. Come prepared for a true boss battle requiring team and item prep for most of these fights.

        4. X-Items like X-Speed, X-Attack, and Guard Spec can now also be used as held items which get used by the holding Pokemon as soon as
        they enter battle. This gives x-items a use, (and a strong one) during hard/tough mode runs of the game.

        5. Shiny rates have been slightly increased. Expect to encounter 1 shiny pokemon during 1/3 of average playthroughs.

        6. All type increasing damage items can now be purchased from the battle frontier fro 64 BP and rare candies are slightly cheaper at 8 BP.

        7. Dynamic weather added to the North East portions of the map. Previously weather could only be encountered on the two routes leading to fortree
        city. Now weather systems based an assumed NE prevailing wind and the orthographic effect will effect the entire north east region.Expect to see 
        more rain in those areas with some cloudy weather thrown in.

        8. This was originally created for my brothers so expect one tough fight that was meant to be an easter egg on route 119.

        9. Nosepass, tangrowth, magneton, Spinda, and electabuzz all recieved slight stat buffs to one or more stats (+- 10 or less change) to bring them 
        more in line with other more viable Pokemon that also do what they do while still maintaining some stat differences to keep each pokemon feeling unique.

        10. Water Route encounter diversity - Ocean routes in Hoenn greatly lacked diversity. Wingull and tentacool remain the most common encounters by far, but 
        it is now possible to rarely encounter a more deisrbale or less common water pokemon. This keeps things interesting. I've designed the encounters with realistic 
        environmental locations for the added pokemon in mind. As an example: one route features staryu as a potential rare surf encounter <10% chance since fishing in the 
        area can also yield a staryu. Fishing Rod Encounter and rod progression remain untouched, and fishing rods are still the most reliable way to get those desirable rare
        encounters more often.

        Finally a shoutout to my brothers who are awesome for playing this ROM hack with me.
