<h2>FEATURES AND CHANGES ADDED TO EMERALD LEGACY:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Added the Following Pokemon feature from Emerald Legacy Enhanced</li>

    <li>
        Added additional difficulty option "Limited Healing Mode" -  
        When asked by professor Birch about the Mauville power plant you can agree to limit your access to Pokecenters and Item Storage  
        forcing you to plan your full heals and rely much more heavily on items out of battle.  
        A new gym badge must be acquired before being able to heal again at any POKECENTER. After becoming champion this no longer applies.   
        Importantly you will also lose half of your non-Key Items and HMS on a white out (so not the battle tower or battle frontier.  
        Item loss will never soft lock you but it can make things much tougher.  
        TM's master balls, etc. are all potentially lost during a white out.  
        This gives incentive to avoid loss without resorting to nuzlocke rules.
        The hard/tough mode from the original Emerald Legacy has had the hard level cap removed and replaced with a soft cap to account for this difficulty option.  
        XP gain will slow greatly upon reaching the level cap but will not be halted.  
        Without this change, it would be possible to lock yourself into a no win situation with no pokeballs or method to alter your available options to deal with an
        impossible encounter.
        (Adding and removing your pokemon from the box will not magically restore them in this mode. Fainted pokemon stay fainted until healed by you)
        (Your mom will no longer provide free healing either)
        Ethers and similar PP restoring items have been added where appropriate to Pokemarts and other lcoations to help ease this difficulty mode.
    </li>

    <li>
        BUFFS - All enemy trainers have had their teams buffed. If you're on the same level as an enemy pokemon expect the fight to be an actual challenge.  
        You might have to switch pokemon or carefully consider move choice.  
        The goal when buffing enemy trainer teams was to keep the player from feeling like a super hero who can mash "A" through most encounters safely.  
        You aren't special but you aren't at a particular disadvantage either, except against boss fights.
        Enemy trainer AI has also been vastly improved.  
        It won't be as smart as you are but it will try its best.  
        Gym leaders, aqua/magma leaders, and the elite four have also seen significant buffs to their AI and teams.  
        Come prepared for a true boss battle requiring team and item prep for most of these fights.
    </li>

    <li>
        X-Items like X-Speed, X-Attack, and Guard Spec can now also be used as held items which get used by the holding Pokemon as soon as they enter battle.  
        This gives x-items a use, (and a strong one) during hard/tough mode runs of the game.
        Very helpful if you know a boss fight is coming up to set up a sweeper or otherwise totally change the field of play.
    </li>

    <li>Shiny rates have been slightly increased. Expect to encounter 1 shiny pokemon during 1/3 of average playthroughs to the elite four.</li>

    <li>All type increasing damage items can now be purchased from the battle frontier fro 64 BP and rare candies are slightly cheaper at 8 BP.</li>

    <li>
        Dynamic weather added to the North East portions of the map.  
        Previously weather could only be encountered on the two routes leading to fortree city.  
        Now weather systems exist from route 118 to Mossdeep with weather patterns based an assumed NE prevailing wind 
        and the orthographic effect. This will effect the entire north east region.  
        Expect to see more rain in those areas with some cloudy weather thrown in. Sunny days are still common.
    </li>

    <li>This was originally created for my brothers so expect one tough fight that was meant to be an easter egg on route 119 with Pokemon Ranger Jackson.</li>

    <li>
        Nosepass, tangrowth, magneton, Spinda, and electabuzz all recieved slight stat buffs to one or more stats (+- 10 or less change)  
        to bring them more in line with other more viable Pokemon that also do what they do while still maintaining some stat differences  
        to keep each pokemon feeling unique.
    </li>

    <li>
        Water Route encounter diversity -  
        Ocean routes in Hoenn greatly lacked diversity. Wingull and tentacool remain the most common encounters by far,  
        but it is now possible to rarely encounter a more deisrbale or less common water pokemon.  
        This keeps things interesting.  
        I've designed the encounters with realistic environmental locations for the added pokemon in mind.  
        As an example: one route features staryu as a potential rare surf encounter &lt;10% chance since fishing in the area can also yield a staryu.  
        Fishing Rod Encounter and rod progression remain untouched, and fishing rods are still the most reliable way to get those desirable rare encounters more often.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally a shoutout to my brothers who are awesome for playing this ROM hack with me.</p>
